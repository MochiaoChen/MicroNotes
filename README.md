## 🧠 Description

Each chapter includes:
- Core definitions and theoretical frameworks  
- Mathematical derivations and proofs  
- Graphical and intuitive interpretations  
- Key formulas and model summaries  

The notes follow the logical structure of **Varian’s _Intermediate Microeconomics: A Modern Approach_**, while incorporating bilingual insights from UIBE’s course materials.
